# Data Analysis Assignment — Iris Dataset

This repository contains my data analysis assignment completed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

##  Contents

- `iris_data_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data loading and inspection
  - Data cleaning
  - Descriptive statistics and group analysis
  - Data visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

##  Tasks Covered

### ✅ Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`
- Converted it to a Pandas DataFrame
- Inspected data types and missing values
- Cleaned dataset (checked for missing data)

### ✅ Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Used `.describe()` to compute statistics
- Grouped by species to find mean values
- Observed patterns across species

### ✅ Task 3: Data Visualization
- Created:
  - Line chart (synthetic time series of petal length)
  - Bar chart (average petal length per species)
  - Histogram (distribution of sepal length)
  - Scatter plot (sepal length vs petal length)
- Plots customized with titles, labels, and legends

##  Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional for styling)
